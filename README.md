# iOS-Swift-TipCalc
This is a sample iOS app written in Swift. It is a learning application. It is a tip calculator that contains a UITextView, UITableView, and a secondary view to add additional percentages. It uses core data to store the different percentages and has a related apple watch app to display the tip amounts on the watch interface. The point of this project is to explore and learn several of the most common components of an iOS app. Still more to come. Need to fix the watch interface. Fork the project to make a new data source and store and retrieve the tip data on a server running node.js and mongoDB. Also will create a tvOS app to display the tip data. The goal is for this to be the most over engineered tip application just to explore and learn all the technologies.
